#Summary of main changes#

### v 1.6 ###

*Moved the masking procedures from main code to flood-filling function.
*Changed masking order (first mask IN source components then mask OUT unassociated components) before flood-filling, to optimise for denser fields.
*Improvements to the single- and multi-component source workflow by coalescing the loops for both types of source.
*Improvements to the masking of non-associated components by introducing a source size-dependent search radius (with minimum threshold).
